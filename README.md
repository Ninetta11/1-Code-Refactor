Assignment 1: Code Refractor


## Edits

The accompanying webpage has been edited, both in the html and css, to make it more accessible and the code cleaner.

Changes have been made to the semantic layout, the structure of the elements, the ordering of attributes and the title of the page.

## Webpage

As far as I can tell, the changes made have maintained the integrity of the webpage and have not interfered with the visual layout in any way.
